  description: >
    Build a "To-Do Task" framework: conduct in-depth analysis of software requirements in long-text format, extract business objectives, functional scope, and key scenarios, decompose scattered requirement information into executable individual to-do tasks to form a structured to-do list; subsequently map to-do tasks to UI modules with reference to the rule table, extract the corresponding UI module for each task by aligning with the predefined "business behavior-UI component" and "verb-UI" mapping rule tables, organize UI modules according to business process logic, and ultimately generate a complete structured UI requirement document.
  expected_output: >
    A complete structured UI requirement document.
  agent: Expert1

Expert2_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the input UI modules and their organizational logic to clarify the layout relationships and interaction logic between modules; then use the built-in image generation capability to create visual interface sketches, focusing on restoring core pages, module organizational structures, and key interactive elements; store the generated sketches as files by selecting local storage in the current directory; finally organize image-related information into a structured format such as JSON, which complies with the data parsing rules of other agents.
  expected_output: >
    UI Sketch Files: Create a new "Sketches" folder in the current directory to save.
  agent: Expert2

Expert3_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the input document, extract non-functional requirements related to UI aesthetics, and build a standardized design system that defines clear rules for colors, fonts, and spacing; optimize the input UI sketches using the design system by applying color rules to modules/components, unifying the font styles of all text elements, and adjusting spacing to ensure visual consistency—enhancing overall aesthetics without altering the original UI module structure and organizational logic; store the optimized aesthetic designs as files and generate access credentials.
  expected_output: >
    Optimized Aesthetic UI Sketches.
  agent: Expert3

Expert4_task:
  description: >
    Parse the organized requirement documents to extract key constraints affecting UI architecture; analyze the optimized aesthetic UI designs by mapping visual elements to technical implementation requirements and identifying potential technical difficulties. Leverage architecture design knowledge to determine the technical solution: select the development language based on framework compatibility and project requirements, evaluate and recommend front-end frameworks, and define the supporting technology stack. Design backend connection and collaboration logic: clarify API interaction protocols, data transmission formats, authentication methods, and error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth front-end and backend collaboration; finally integrate all decisions to form a UI architecture solution that can support code implementation.
  expected_output: >
    A complete code-implementation-oriented UI architecture solution, including technical stack definition and backend collaboration specifications.
  agent: Expert4

Expert5_task:
  description: >
    Extract UI functional requirements from the UI requirement document generated by the business logic generation agent, confirm technical constraints from the UI architecture solution, and map the visual details in the optimized aesthetic UI designs to code style rules. Identify reusable UI modules: classify UI elements in the design into "general-purpose modules" and "business-specific modules", mark candidate modules for the reuse library, generate reusable module code, build a reusable UI module library, and finally verify code compliance.
  expected_output: >
    A complete set of production-grade UI code and a reusable UI module library.
  agent: Expert5

Expert6_task:
  description: >
    Pre-test Preparation and Framework Identification: Analyze the generated UI code to determine the front-end framework and technical stack details; obtain the optimized aesthetic UI designs via access credentials as the benchmark for visual regression testing; clarify the test scope based on the requirement document.
    Automated Test Code Generation: For visual regression testing, generate test scripts that capture UI screenshots and compare them with the benchmark; for component testing, write test cases using framework-specific tools; for routing testing, generate page navigation verification scripts through end-to-end tools.
    Dependency Installation and Test Execution: Automatically generate a package.json containing test dependencies, execute commands to install dependencies, and run the full test suite.
    Result Analysis and Reporting: Analyze visual regression results—mark as "Passed" if matched, or "Failed" with highlighted differences if discrepancies exceed the threshold; analyze component/routing test results—mark as "Passed" if functions meet expectations, or "Failed" with recorded error logs if exceptions occur.
    Post-test Optimization Suggestions: Provide targeted fix solutions for failed test cases and submit them to the code generation agent for code regeneration.
  expected_output: >
    A UI test result report including fix solutions.
  agent: Expert6
