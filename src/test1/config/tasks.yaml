# --- 第一阶段：需求分析 ---
Expert1_Analysis_Task:
  description: >
    First, retrieve and carefully review the two rule tables ("Business-UI" and "Verb-UI") from the Knowledge Base to master the precise mapping relationships between business actions and frontend components. Taking this as the theoretical basis, conduct an in-depth analysis of the Product Requirements Document (PRD), sort out the overall business processes, and complete system classification (such as application-type, backend management-type, etc.) based on system functional attributes. Subsequently, strictly apply the mapping logic in the two aforementioned tables to accurately and separately extract the requirements that need to be implemented through frontend development for each step of the business processes. Finally, conduct a self-assessment on the completeness and accuracy of the extracted frontend requirements. If deviations are identified, an iterative optimization process must be initiated (with a maximum of 3 repetitions) until the requirements are clear, accurate, and error-free.

# --- 第四阶段：代码生成 (含 Expert3 评审) ---
Expert4_Code_Draft_Task:
  description: >
    First, use the FileReadTool to retrieve and carefully review the component definitions in the "frontend_components.json" file from the Knowledge Base to master the specific code structures and property specifications of the reusable components. Analyze the UI Agent's design and Requirements List.
    IMPORTANT RULES:
       1. Do NOT save files yet. Just generate the code content in your memory/response.
       2. Plan a standard React project structure:
          - `src/components/` for reusable components.
          - `src/pages/` for main pages.
          - `src/App.js` and `src/index.css`.
          - `package.json` (Must include dependencies like react, tailwindcss).
    Strictly apply the code patterns from "frontend_components.json" to generate production-grade UI code.
  expected_output: >
    A confirmation string listing all the files that have been successfully saved into the `./output_project/` directory. NO ZIP FILES.

    FINAL SAVING INSTRUCTION (CRITICAL):
      You must use the "Project Saver Tool" to save ALL files at once.
      Tool Arguments Requirement:
        1. `project_name`: set to "frontend_project"
        2. `files`: A list of objects. Each object MUST use the key `file_path` (Do NOT use `path`).
           - Correct: `{"file_path": "src/App.js", "content": "..."}`
           - Incorrect: `{"path": "src/App.js", ...}`
    Ensure you include `package.json`, `README.md`, and all source code.
  expected_output: >
    A confirmation message from the tool saying "Project saved to folder...".
